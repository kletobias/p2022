📢 **Exciting News: My MLOps Pipeline Architecture Accepted at MLOps25 @ ECAI 2025**

I'm thrilled to announce that my work on eliminating configuration debt in MLOps pipelines has been accepted for presentation at the MLOps25 Workshop at ECAI 2025!

**The Paper:**
"Killing Configuration Debt with a Single-Source, DVC-Driven Pipeline: An Industrial Experience Report"

**Key Results Achieved:**
• 90% reduction in build time
• 90% reduction in engineer touch-time  
• Zero configuration-related rollbacks
• 80% operational cost reduction

**Repository Update:**
To prepare for the academic presentation, I've restructured the codebase:
🔗 New location: github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-demo

The demonstration version showcases the architectural patterns while protecting proprietary implementations developed for production use.

**What This Means:**
This conference acceptance validates that the configuration-driven approach I developed isn't just practically effective—it represents a significant contribution to MLOps best practices worthy of peer review.

Looking forward to presenting these findings to the MLOps community at ECAI 2025!

Hi [Name],

Wanted to share that the MLOps pipeline project you engaged with has been accepted at MLOps25 @ ECAI 2025!

For the conference presentation, I've restructured the repository to: github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-demo

The demo showcases the architecture that achieved 90% performance improvements in production. The full implementation remains available for commercial licensing.

Best regards,
Tobias

Great timing on your question! The repository has been restructured for my presentation at MLOps25 @ ECAI 2025. 

The new demonstration version is at: github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-demo

It showcases the same architectural patterns that achieved the 90% performance improvements, with proprietary implementations protected for commercial use. The conference acceptance validates this approach as a significant contribution to MLOps best practices.

🎯 **The Hidden Cost of Configuration Debt in MLOps**

Following up on my MLOps25 acceptance: Why did eliminating configuration debt matter so much?

**The Problem:**
Traditional MLOps pipelines suffer from configuration sprawl—multiple sources of truth leading to drift, rollbacks, and maintenance nightmares.

**The Solution:**
A single-source, DVC-driven pipeline with type-safe configurations.

**The Impact:**
• 90% reduction in build time
• Zero configuration-related rollbacks
• 80% operational cost reduction

The demonstration is available at: github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-demo

Full paper will be presented at ECAI 2025. The approach transforms configuration from a liability into an asset.
