## 📢 Conference Presentation

This work has been accepted for presentation at **MLOps25 Workshop @ ECAI 2025**:

**"Killing Configuration Debt with a Single-Source, DVC-Driven Pipeline: An Industrial Experience Report"**

To prepare for the academic presentation, the repository has been restructured to separate:
- **Public demonstration** (architectural patterns)
- **Proprietary implementations** (commercial value)

## 🎯 Proven Results

The pipeline architecture achieved in production:
- ✅ **90% reduction** in build time
- ✅ **90% reduction** in engineer touch-time  
- ✅ **Zero** configuration-related rollbacks
- ✅ **80% reduction** in operational costs

## 🏗️ Key Innovations

### 1. Universal Step Pattern
- Single orchestrator for all transformations
- Dynamic dispatch based on configuration
- Eliminates code duplication

### 2. Template-Driven Pipeline Generation
- Hydra → Jinja2 → DVC flow
- Eliminates config/code drift
- Single source of truth

### 3. Zero-Rollback Configuration Management
- Type-safe dataclass configurations
- Hash-based artifact validation
- Configuration as code
