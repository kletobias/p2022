🚀 **Exciting Update: My MLOps Pipeline Project Has Evolved!**

Remember that MLOps pipeline I built in 4 weeks while learning 6+ technologies from scratch? It's now being presented at **MLOps25 @ ECAI 2025** and has a new home!

**What's New:**
🔄 Repository restructured for academic presentation
🛡️ Created demo version with IP protection  
📚 Preparing for peer-reviewed publication
💼 Full version available for commercial licensing

**The Numbers Still Stand:**
• 90% reduction in processing time
• 80% operational cost reduction  
• Zero configuration-related rollbacks
• Built by 1 developer in 4 weeks

**New Repository Location:**
🔗 github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-demo

This demo version showcases the architectural patterns and innovations while protecting the proprietary implementations that made those impressive metrics possible.

**Why This Matters:**
This isn't just a repository move - it's a validation of the approach. The fact that this work is conference-worthy and commercially viable proves that rapid learning and innovative engineering can create real value.

**For Those Following My Journey:**
If you've bookmarked the old repository, please update to the new location. If you're interested in the full implementation for your organization, let's connect!

Hi [Name],

Quick update on the MLOps pipeline project you engaged with previously:

The repository has moved to **github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-demo** as I'm presenting it at MLOps25 @ ECAI 2025.

This demo version showcases the architecture that achieved those 90% performance improvements while protecting the proprietary implementations.

If your organization could benefit from similar improvements, I'd be happy to discuss the full implementation.

Best regards,
Tobias

**"Why can't I access the old repository?"**

Great question! The repository has been restructured for academic presentation at MLOps25 @ ECAI 2025. The new demo version is at github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-demo. 

This change allows me to share the architectural innovations while protecting valuable IP. The demo shows the patterns that achieved 90% performance improvements - the full implementation is available commercially.

**"Is the new version the same as the old one?"**

The demo version shows the same architectural patterns and approach but with simplified implementations. Think of it as the "academic proof" version - it demonstrates the concepts while the production version (available commercially) contains the optimizations that achieve the impressive metrics.

**"Can I still learn from the demo version?"**

Absolutely! The demo version showcases:
- Complete configuration-driven architecture
- DVC pipeline orchestration
- Hydra configuration patterns
- Modular transformation system
- MLflow integration patterns

It's perfect for understanding the approach and architecture.
