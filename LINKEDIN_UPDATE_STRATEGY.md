### 4. 📝 LinkedIn Article Update Strategy

**For LinkedIn Articles (Different from Posts):**
- Articles CAN be edited anytime!
- Update all articles with new links
- Add update notice at the top:

```markdown
> **[Updated January 2025]**: Repository links have been updated to the new demo version. Some implementation details have been simplified for IP protection.
```

### 5. 🎯 Targeted Outreach

**For High-Value Connections:**
- If someone important engaged with your old posts
- Send them a direct message:

```markdown
Hi [Name],

You previously engaged with my MLOps pipeline project post. I wanted to let you know the repository has moved to a new location: github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-demo

This demo version showcases the architecture while protecting proprietary elements. The full implementation is available for commercial licensing if you're interested.

Best regards,
Tobias
```

### 6. 🔮 Future-Proofing Strategy

**Create a Link Management System:**

1. **Use Link Shorteners with Analytics:**
   - bit.ly, rebrandly, or your own domain
   - Can update destination without changing the short link
   - Example: `yoursite.com/mlops-repo` → redirects to current repo

2. **Portfolio Landing Page:**
   - Create `yoursite.com/mlops-project`
   - Always link to this in social media
   - Update the page with current links

3. **GitHub Profile README:**
   - Add a section with current project links
   - People often check your GitHub profile

### 7. 📊 Analytics & Monitoring

**Track Impact:**
1. Monitor 404s on the old repository (if public)
2. Track clicks on new repository
3. Monitor LinkedIn post engagement after comments
4. Check portfolio website analytics

## Implementation Priority

### Week 1 (Immediate):
1. ✅ Make old repository a redirect (Option A above)
2. ✅ Create pinned LinkedIn post
3. ✅ Update all LinkedIn articles

### Week 2:
1. ✅ Comment on high-engagement old posts
2. ✅ Set up link shortener for future posts
3. ✅ Create portfolio landing page

### Ongoing:

3. ✅ Update GitHub profile README

## Sample Templates
