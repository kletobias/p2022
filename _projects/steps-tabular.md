# The Six Tasks In Every Machine Learning Project: Tabular Data

A predictive modeling machine learning project can be split into the following 6
main tasks. This list is tailored for tabular data. You can find the list for
image and more generally unstructured data in the article [**The Six Tasks In
Every ML Project: Unstructured Data**]({% link _projects/steps-unstructured.md
%})

1. Understand the fundamentals: Understand and characterize the problem.
    - Understand the input data. E.g., Type of input data, independent and
        dependent variables, size of input data, format of input data.
    - What is it, that the model has to predict in the end?
2. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)
    - Analyze the how the raw data looks like. E.g., Look at unique values for
        each column, visualize missing data, analyze data types.
    - Create Visualizations that show univariate/bivariate/multivariate distributions and correlations
    - Understand what the final data type should be for each column in the
        dataset.
3. Baseline Scores & [Feature Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering)
