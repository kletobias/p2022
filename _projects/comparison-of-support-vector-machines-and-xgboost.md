Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and XGBoost are both popular machine learning algorithms, but they have different strengths and are suitable for different types of problems<d-footnote>Cortes, C., & Vapnik, V. (1995). Support-vector networks. Machine learning, 20(3), 273-297.</d-footnote><d-footnote>Chen, T., & Guestrin, C. (2016). XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 785-794).</d-footnote>. Here are some scenarios where SVMs may be a better choice than XGBoost:

1. High-Dimensional Data: SVMs can handle high-dimensional data well, especially when the number of features is larger than the number of samples<d-footnote>Guyon, I., & Elisseeff, A. (2003). An introduction to variable and feature selection. Journal of machine learning research, 3(Mar), 1157-1182.</d-footnote>. They are effective in situations where the feature space is sparse or there are a large number of irrelevant features<d-footnote>Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., & Friedman, J. (2009). The elements of statistical learning: data mining, inference, and prediction. Springer Science & Business Media.</d-footnote>. XGBoost, on the other hand, may struggle with high-dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality<d-footnote>Bellman, R. (1961). Adaptive control processes: a guided tour. Princeton University Press.</d-footnote>.

2. Small to Medium-Sized Datasets: SVMs can perform well on small to medium-sized datasets, particularly when the number of samples is comparable to or smaller than the number of features<d-footnote>Schoelkopf, B., & Smola, A. (2002). Learning with kernels: support vector machines, regularization, optimization, and beyond. MIT press.</d-footnote>. XGBoost generally requires a larger amount of data to achieve optimal performance<d-footnote>Chen, T., & Guestrin, C. (2016). XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 785-794).</d-footnote>.

3. Non-Linear Decision Boundaries: SVMs are inherently capable of finding non-linear decision boundaries by using kernel functions<d-footnote>Schölkopf, B., & Smola, A. J. (2002). Support vector machines and kernel methods: the new generation of learning machines. AI magazine, 23(3), 31-41.</d-footnote>. By selecting an appropriate kernel, SVMs can effectively separate complex classes<d-footnote>Vapnik, V. N. (1998). Statistical learning theory. Wiley.</d-footnote>. XGBoost, on the other hand, is primarily designed for gradient boosting and may require additional techniques (e.g., feature engineering) to handle non-linear relationships in the data<d-footnote>Chen, T., & Guestrin, C. (2016). XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 785-794).</d-footnote>.

4. Outlier Detection: SVMs are sensitive to outliers, and this can be advantageous in certain scenarios where identifying and separating outliers from the main data clusters is important<d-footnote>Schölkopf, B., Smola, A., & Müller, K. R. (1999). Kernel principal component analysis. Advances in kernel methods—support vector learning, 41(2), 327-352.</d-footnote>. XGBoost, being an ensemble method, may be less sensitive to individual outliers<d-footnote>Chen, T., & Guestrin, C. (2016). XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 785-794).</d-footnote>.

5. Interpretability: SVMs provide more interpretable models since the decision boundary is represented by a subset of support vectors<d-footnote>Boser, B. E., Guyon, I. M., & Vapnik, V. N. (1992). A training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers. Proceedings of the fifth annual workshop on Computational learning theory, 144-152.</d-footnote>. This can be useful in scenarios where understanding the importance of specific data points in the decision-making process is crucial<d-footnote>Cortes, C., & Vapnik, V. (1995). Support-vector networks. Machine learning, 20(3), 273-297.</d-footnote>. XGBoost, on the other hand, is an ensemble of decision trees, which can be more complex and less interpretable<d-footnote>Chen, T., & Guestrin, C. (2016). XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 785-794).</d-footnote>.

It's worth noting that XGBoost generally performs well on a wide range of problems, especially when dealing with large datasets and when high predictive accuracy is the primary objective<d-footnote>Chen, T., & Guestrin, C. (2016). XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (pp. 785-794).</d-footnote>. However, SVMs may have advantages in specific cases as mentioned above. The choice between SVMs and XGBoost ultimately depends on the specific characteristics of your data, the problem at hand, and your priorities in terms of interpretability, computational efficiency, and accuracy<d-footnote>Cortes, C., & Vapnik, V. (1995). Support-vector networks. Machine learning, 20(3), 273-297.</d-footnote><d-footnote>Chen, T., & Guestrin, C. (2016). XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system.
