# Predictive Modeling Machine Learning Project: Tasks

A predictive modeling machine learning project can be split into the following 6
main tasks:

1. Understand the fundamentals: Understand and characterize the problem.



2. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)
    - Create Visualizations that show univariate/bivariate/multivariate distributions and correlations
    - Understand what the final data type, range for each value, and dimensions should be.
    - Analyze the raw data and apply transformations needed for training any model on it.
3. Baseline Scores & [Feature Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering)
