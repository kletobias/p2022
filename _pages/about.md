I follow two principles, in this order. A methodically clean and conscientious approach followed by the clear and aesthetically pleasing communication of information. In addition, I do my best to use the available tools efficiently and flexibly. Be it the commands provided by the CentOS (~Red Hat Linux) distribution for system administration, the workflow in Python for reading raw data from .csv files, custom web scraping algorithms or from a database directly, to a production-ready predictive machine learning model that can be deployed via Docker or AWS and serve the client's purposes.

A balance between low deployment costs through virtualization and the use of scalable, on-demand cloud services that keep costs in check, and a competitive advantage for the customer through the use of the finished product.
