## Welcome

> Embracing the power of predictive modeling, I meld data and
innovation, to unravel patterns today for actionable insights tomorrow, paving
the way to a future steered by foresight and proactive decision-making.

### The Concept

This site stands for openness and simplicity. It presents my work in an easy-to-understand manner, showing the work I've done from start to finish. I use Python for creating reusable solutions, and often engage with [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and [competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) to test and compare my work.

### The Tools

I mainly use Python, with strong skills in MySQL for bringing in data (using `sqlalchemy`). You can see a complete list of the Python tools I use on the [**Toolkit Section of the CV page**]({% link _pages/cv.md %}).

Look at the [projects]({{ '/projects/' | relative_url }}) page to see a variety of my work.

### Data Preprocessing

Projects in this group show my ability to make *disorderly tabular data* clean and ready for machine learning. Some of the works that explain this skill include:

- [**Cleaning a web scraped 47 column pandas dataframe: Part 3**]({% link _projects/cleaning-a-web-scraped-47-column-br-pandas-dataframe-br-part-3.md %})
- [**Cleaning a web scraped 47 column pandas dataframe: Part 4**]({% link _projects/cleaning-a-web-scraped-47-column-br-pandas-dataframe-br-part-4.md %})
- [**Advanced Geospatial Feature Creation**]({% link _projects/advanced-geospatial-feature-creation.md %})

### Deep Learning

Here, you'll find my high-level work in deep learning. They cover both theory and practice:

- [**The Math behind \"Stepping the Weights\"**]({% link _projects/the-math-behind-br-stepping-the-weights.md %})
- [**Automation using a Test Harness for Deep Learning: Part 1**]({% link _projects/automation-using-a-test-harness-br-for-deep-learning-br-part-1.md %})
- [**Automation using a Test Harness for Deep Learning: Part 2**]({% link _projects/automation-using-a-test-harness-br-for-deep-learning-br-part-2.md %})

### Tabular Data

This group contains a mix of works that deal with many parts of the machine learning process, like cleaning data, creating features, applying deep learning models to table data, checking with cross-validation, and tweaking with hyperparameter optimization. You might like to see:

- [**Fill missing values and categorical embeddings**]({% link _projects/deep-dive-tabular-data-pt-1.md %})
- [**Kaggle submission 1: Training RandomForestRegressor and Deep Learning model**]({% link _projects/deep-dive-tabular-data-pt-6.md %})
- [**Kaggle submission 2: XGBoost Regressor - RandomSearchCV**]({% link _projects/deep-dive-tabular-data-pt-7.md %})
