## Current Position

Currently, I am passionately devoted to full-time machine learning competitions,
with the intent of continuously enhancing my expertise in this dynamic domain.
My work predominantly revolves around addressing intricate machine learning
challenges associated with unstructured data types, such as images, videos, or
textual content, utilizing the powerful PyTorch framework. In the context of
structured data, like tabular information, I employ advanced tree-based and deep
learning models, systematically comparing their predictive accuracy and
interpretability to ascertain the most suitable solution for the problem at
hand.

To rigorously evaluate the efficacy of my cutting-edge predictive modeling
techniques across various domains, such as regression, classification, or
computer vision tasks, I actively partake in [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com)
competitions. Engaging in these contests offers invaluable exposure to
practical, real-world industry challenges, further expanding my knowledge and
skillset.

### Advanced Expertise in Machine Learning

Utilizing Python and a systematic approach, I tackle complex machine learning
challenges by adhering to a comprehensive multi-step process, as illustrated in
these articles:

- For structured data, such as tabular data from a database or flat file:
    - [*The Tasks In Every Machine Learning Project: Structured
Data*](https://deep-learning-mastery.com/projects/the-tasks-in-every-machine-learning-project-br-tabular-data/)

- For unstructured data, such as text, image, video data:
    - [*The Tasks In Every Machine Learning Project: Unstructured Data*](https://deep-learning-mastery.com/projects/the-tasks-in-every-machine-learning-project-br-unstructured-data/)

The methodology is in accordance with the esteemed Stanford University's
[Practical Machine Learning](https://c.d2l.ai/stanford-cs329p/) course. In the
context of structured data, it is essential to undertake a number of pivotal
steps, which may include:

- Problem Definition
    - Regression analysis
    - Classification tasks
    - Advanced problem types
- Data Preparation
    - Sophisticated data preprocessing techniques
    - Robust feature selection methods
    - Ingenious feature engineering strategies
- Model Development
    - Identification and evaluation of suitable models
    - Hyperparameter optimization (optional, contingent on the model)
    - Thorough model evaluation and interpretation (objective: estimating model performance on unseen data)
    - Model finalization and refinement
    - Persuasive solution presentation and communication

## Bachelors Thesis

### Data Mining: Hyperparameter Optimization For Real Estate Prediction Models
<strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
Combining a highly scalable and customizable process,
with very accurate prediction results using machine learning models, is what
this work proposes. The customization is guided by what information the user
seeks to gain from the process. This makes the process applicable for a variety
of sectors, such as Banking & Finance, Marketing and urban development among
others. It evaluates the process of using self-acquired data from an online real
estate platform, gained from deploying a custom web scraping algorithm. This
data is then combined with several spatial features for predicting the base rent
for apartments on a validation dataset. The analysis and predictions are made
for rental apartment listings within the Hanseatic City of Hamburg. The spatial
features originate from sources other than that of the apartments data and have
to be adapted to it first, therefore. Predictions are made using state of the
art machine learning models, in the form of a **Lasso Regression** model and a
**XGBoost Regressor** model. The Hyperparameter Optimisation techniques **grid
search** and **random search** are compared, during the optimisation process.
The focus is on maximising prediction accuracy of the models. The best scores,
expressed in **RMSE**, are 190.68 for the **Lasso** and 115.39 for the **XGBoost
Regressor**. Differences in complexity and interpretability between the models
are discussed and associated with it, the strengths and weaknesses of the
respective model are pointed out.<br>
