# Spotlight: Feature Engineering for Reproducibility and Scalability

A strong feature engineering pipeline should maintain clean separation between data ingestion, cleaning, and transformation steps. In this project, the code under [dependencies/transformations](https://github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-lifecycle-hydra-mlflow-optuna-dvc/tree/main/dependencies/transformations) implements discrete, reusable operations for tasks like aggregating severity data ([dependencies/transformations/agg_severities.py](https://github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-lifecycle-hydra-mlflow-optuna-dvc/tree/main/dependencies/transformations/agg_severities.py)) or dropping rare DRGs ([dependencies/transformations/drop_rare_drgs.py](https://github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-lifecycle-hydra-mlflow-optuna-dvc/tree/main/dependencies/transformations/drop_rare_drgs.py)). Each script references a corresponding YAML config (for instance, [configs/transformations/agg_severities.yaml](https://github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-lifecycle-hydra-mlflow-optuna-dvc/tree/main/configs/transformations/agg_severities.yaml)), ensuring typed, standardized parameters.

Tracking these transformations through version control in Git and DVC guarantees consistent behavior between training and inference. A single misalignment in feature transformations can degrade model performance in production, so each step is reviewed and validated using typed dataclasses and [logs](https://github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-lifecycle-hydra-mlflow-optuna-dvc/blob/main/logs/pipeline/2025-03-21_16-37-51.log). Metadata capture functions ([dependencies/metadata/calculate_metadata.py](https://github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-lifecycle-hydra-mlflow-optuna-dvc/tree/main/dependencies/metadata/calculate_metadata.py)) add further visibility into each featureâ€™s lineage. When transformations stay modular and thoroughly documented, even complex pipelines remain flexible, reproducible, and easy to extend.
