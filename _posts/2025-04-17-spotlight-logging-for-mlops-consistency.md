# Spotlight: Logging for MLOps Consistency

A unified logging strategy underpins every stage of this MLOps pipeline. Hydra configuration files, such as [configs/logging_utils/base.yaml](https://github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-lifecycle-hydra-mlflow-optuna-dvc/tree/main/configs/logging_utils/base.yaml) define a uniform format and verbosity level, ensuring consistent output from scripts managing data ingestion, transformations, or hyperparameter optimization. By assigning a unique run ID to each pipeline execution, logs tie neatly into both DVC and MLflow runs.

When partial steps are rerun with `dvc repro`, the pipeline references the same logging configuration, guaranteeing consistency of output. For extensive hyperparameter searches, scripts like [dependencies/modeling/rf_optuna_trial.py](https://github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-lifecycle-hydra-mlflow-optuna-dvc/tree/main/dependencies/modeling/rf_optuna_trial.py) record each trialâ€™s metrics in MLflow while also appending pertinent messages to local log files. Prefect flows can capture and forward logs to the same destination for a cohesive monitoring approach.

- Maintaining structured, level-based logging is recommended. Transformations and statuses remain at INFO, deeper debugging details at DEBUG, and critical errors at ERROR.
- This systematic design prevents excessive verbosity while retaining essential information, thus simplifying post-run analysis and ensuring reproducibility.
