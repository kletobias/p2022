# Spotlight: Modular Code as a Cornerstone of MLOps

Modular code separates each pipeline function—data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, training—into well-defined modules. By following a single-responsibility principle and keeping configuration details in YAML, the pipeline in this project remains flexible and reusable. For instance, references to [configs/transformations](https://github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-lifecycle-hydra-mlflow-optuna-dvc/tree/main/configs/transformations) align each module’s parameters with typed dataclasses in [dependencies/transformations](https://github.com/kletobias/advanced-mlops-lifecycle-hydra-mlflow-optuna-dvc/tree/main/dependencies/transformations).

**Key Advantages**

- **Maintainability**: Minimal changes ripple through code, as each module focuses on a narrow set of tasks.
- **Parallelism**: Orchestration tools like DVC or Prefect can run independent modules concurrently.
- **Consistency**: Each module logs its activity and uses typed configs, reducing guesswork when debugging.
- **Scalability**: Adding new transformations or new model variants requires only adding or modifying a module and its YAML, rather than refactoring monolithic code.

In short, embracing modular code fosters clarity, accelerates development, and strengthens reproducibility throughout the MLOps lifecycle.
