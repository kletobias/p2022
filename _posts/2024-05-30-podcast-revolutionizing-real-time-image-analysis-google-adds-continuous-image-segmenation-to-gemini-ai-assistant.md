# Revolutionizing Real-Time Image Analysis: Google adds Continuous Image Segmentation to Gemini AI Assistant

In the latest [episode](#the-podcast) of the Nice Machine Learning Podcast we embark on a thrilling journey into the heart of the AI revolution.

## Introduction

Welcome to Nice Machine Learning Podcast, the show where we dive deep into the cutting-edge world of technology and innovation! Join us as we explore the latest advancements from Google's DeepMind project, as unveiled in their recent keynote.

## Gemini 1.5 Flash: A New Era in AI

One of the standout announcements was the introduction of their updated Gemini Large Language Model, named **Gemini 1.5 Flash**. Positioned just below their flagship **Gemini Pro** model, Gemini 1.5 Flash boasts significantly reduced latency times for generating responses to user inputs, all while being more cost-effective.

## Key Features of Gemini 1.5 Flash

During the keynote, Google highlighted several key features, including a continuous image segmentation capability. This feature can handle continuous video input and maintain track of its previous image segmentation predictions, thanks to its massive context window of up to 1 million tokens. And soon, this will be expanded to an impressive 2 million tokens. It remains to be seen how well the model's attention mechanism can handle such an enormous context window in practice.

## Real-Time Response Capability

What truly sets Gemini 1.5 Flash apart is its near real-time response capability. Unlike other major players in the LLM assistant market—such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Amazon—Google has managed to cut down on latency. This means that Gemini 1.5 Flash can greatly reduce the noticeable, iterative prediction process that other models perform for each generated token of output.

## Advanced Image Segmentation

Google's latest deep learning platform, Gemini—evolved from BERT—now features advanced image segmentation akin to those in autonomous vehicles. Gemini's agents can precisely predict every detail in video frames almost instantaneously, crucial for real-time applications.

## Applications in Real-World Scenarios

At Fleet State, a vehicle body condition tracking startup assisting rental car companies in assessing vehicle bodies after returns, we rely on powerful image segmentation techniques. Image segmentation is a multi-class categorization method that predicts every part of an input image, enabling precise delineation of objects within the scene. We chose implementations like Keras U-Net, Detectron2's Mask R-CNN, and TensorFlow DeepLab for their effectiveness and flexibility. Keras U-Net offers highly customizable solutions for precise boundary delineation, Detectron2's Mask R-CNN provides state-of-the-art performance for instance segmentation, and TensorFlow DeepLab excels in capturing multi-scale context for complex segmentation tasks. These implementations allow us to deliver accurate and reliable assessments of vehicle bodies after each rental return.

## Privacy and Ethical Considerations

The continuous image segmentation feature in Google's Gemini platform, similar to Tesla's utilization of camera data for its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving functionalities, involves the significant collection of video data. While Tesla employs this data to enhance its autonomous driving algorithms using anonymized datasets, Google's approach with Gemini could extend these capabilities further. This stands in contrast to OpenAI, which, despite its vast user-generated training data from diverse applications like multi-modal mobile apps and browser-based platforms, does not collect video data for image segmentation. This distinction marks a unique selling point for Gemini. However, the value of this feature hinges on its practical utility to customers and Google’s ability to manage the associated privacy concerns with the utmost care to prevent breaches. The effectiveness and appeal of Gemini’s advanced capabilities remain to be fully evaluated by the market.

## Market Implications

It remains to be seen if Google can narrow the gap to the current market leader, OpenAI. Stay tuned as we continue to monitor these exciting developments in the world of AI.
