# OpenAI Reveals new Chat GPT-5 Flagship Models

<br>

> **… and then there was only GPT‑5**

## Summary

tl;dr OpenAI collapsed the lineup across both the API and the ChatGPT apps (browser, desktop, iOS, Android). The table below shows a simple before → after map so you can translate any prior model reference to the new GPT‑5 family.

## API - Most models are still available

You can still use most of the "old" models through the API. You find the complete list of models available through the API here:
[OpenAI API Models documentation - https://platform.openai.com/docs/models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)

## API — mapping highlights

- o3 → GPT‑5 + medium/high reasoning
- o3‑pro → **~ GPT‑5 + high reasoning** (Not confirmed but likely)
- o4‑mini → GPT‑5 mini + prompt tuning
- o4‑mini high → GPT‑5 mini + prompt tuning
- GPT‑4o → GPT‑5 Chat
- GPT‑4.1 → GPT‑5 Chat
- GPT‑4.5 Research Preview → GPT‑5 Chat

## ChatGPT apps — what you now see

- “GPT‑5” (model name in the UI; uses GPT‑5 Chat under the hood)
- “GPT‑5 Thinking” (not clear what it uses under the hood)
- “GPT‑5 Pro” (not clear what it uses under the hood)

## Visualizing the changes

The slide below visualizes both sections side‑by‑side: API mappings on top, ChatGPT apps mappings at the bottom. Attach the image to this post for the full before/after view.
