# AI Adds Comments EVERYWHERE

## Opinion

As a seasoned machine learning engineer, I’ve seen code reviews go from enlightening discussions to full-on literary critiques, thanks to comments.

Recently, I’ve been battling a new adversary: the overly-commented AI-generated code. Imagine this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash                            # shebang line
set -e                                 # exit on error
```

A shell script WITH COMMENTS EVERYWHERE. Lines that haven’t changed are now “changed” simply because AI decided to write a novella of explanations.

Don’t get me wrong—clarity is good. But when your version control diff looks like:

```diff
- set -e
+ set -e                                 # exit on error
```

…it feels less like engineering and more like an English lit analysis assignment!

On the bright side, this kind of “over-documentation” does have its perks. My non-coder friends can finally understand what I’m doing—although now they think most of my work is writing comments!

Anyone else dealing with this new wave of hyper-verbal automation in code generation? How do you balance clarity with conciseness?

Also, pro tip: The regex substitution to remove comments is now something I’m making a keybind for!
