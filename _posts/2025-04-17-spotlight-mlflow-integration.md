# Spotlight: MLflow Integration

This spotlight highlights how MLflow is integrated into a Hydra-based pipeline for reliable experiment tracking. The [long_post] explains a configuration-driven workflow, complete with S3 synchronization and environment logging, ensuring reproducibility across local and remote work. It covers naming conventions, artifact control, and final model logging. Teams thus maintain streamlined, secure experiment logs with minimal overhead.
