## Summary Of The Series

> This series demonstrates my deep expertise in pandas and pyjanitor for advanced data exploration and cleaning. In Part 1, "[Mastery in Pandas: In-Depth Data Exploration, Part 1]({% link _projects/cleaning-a-web-scraped-47-column-br-pandas-dataframe-br-part-1.md %}),” a 47-column dataset is analyzed to showcase complex tabular data management. Dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to retain only relevant columns. Part 2, "[PyJanitor Proficiency: Efficient String Data Cleaning, Part 2]({% link _projects/cleaning-a-web-scraped-47-column-br-pandas-dataframe-br-part-2.md %}),” leverages pyjanitor's method chaining syntax to enhance the speed and efficiency of string data cleaning. The focus is on unique column values to guide the cleaning steps.

> Regular expressions (regex) are extensively used in Part 4, "[Advanced Data Cleaning and Validation: Batch Processing with Pandas, Part 4]({% link _projects/cleaning-a-web-scraped-47-column-br-pandas-dataframe-br-part-4.md %}),” for extracting and validating cell contents, replacing invalid patterns with valid ones. Additionally, this part emphasizes handling large volumes of tabular data through batch processing. Part 3, "[Geospatial Engineering in Pandas: Creating Valid GPS Columns, Part 3]({% link _projects/cleaning-a-web-scraped-47-column-br-pandas-dataframe-br-part-3.md %}),” highlights the creation and validation of `Point` geometry `gps` columns by merging longitude and latitude fields into GPS data columns. The series culminates with the creation of new `timedelta64[ns]` `time_listed` and `gps` columns, illustrating advanced data cleaning and validation techniques.
